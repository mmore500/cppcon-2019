# Introduction

Title and brief overview of what the poster reports on.

# Relevance

Why the work is interesting, and what problems it addresses.

# Discussion

Technical description of the presented topic.

# Completion Status

Empirical is under continuous active development to broaden its tool set, accommodate API changes in the Emscripten compiler, and incorporate new methods from the cutting edge of digital evolution.
However, major library components --- including  web, debug, and digital evolution tools --- are stable and actively used in multiple projects, both inside and outside the Digital Evolution Laboratory.

**Matthew Andres Moreno (`mmore500@msu.edu`)**

Matthew Andres Moreno is a doctoral student at the Michigan State University Department of Computer Science and Engineering working in the Digital Evolution Laboratory.
His research applies digital evolution methods to study major transitions in evolution and the relationship between genetic encoding schemes and evolvability.

**Charles Ofria (`ofria@msu.edu`)**

Charles Ofria is a faculty member of the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, where he leads the Digital Evolution Laboratory and serves as director for the NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action.
He conducts research on evolution in artificial systems and applies the results to problems in computer science and evolutionary biology.
He developed Avida, a software-based research platform consisting of populations of digital organisms used in biological research.
His research has focused more generally on understanding how evolution produces complex traits and behaviors, with the long-term goal of applying these concepts to the evolution of computational intelligence.
